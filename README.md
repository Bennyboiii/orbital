# Orbital
An ergonomic window manager for Stardust XR

## CONCEPT BUILD
This is a non-functional concept build meant for laying out a simple script for an XR window manager, and is also my way of learning rust and the stardustxr
crates for said project. Running with the current build, one can only interact with prerendered 3D models meant to represent objects for the future window
manager.
